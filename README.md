# Ball & Chain

## Description
This is a simple time tracking app for freelancers. It allows you to track your time spent on projects and tasks, and generate reports based on that data.

Information is stored in JSON files and indexed in memory, so it's not intended for large-scale use.

Version control should be done committing the JSON files.
